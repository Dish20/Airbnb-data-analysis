📊 Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data to uncover key trends in pricing, availability, and guest preferences. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore rental markets, identify profitable locations, and understand host performance metrics.

🔍 Business Problem

The goal of this analysis was to answer critical questions for potential hosts and investors:

💰 Pricing Strategy: How does location (zipcode/neighborhood) impact listing prices?

🏠 Product Preferences: Which room types (Entire home, Private room) are most popular?

📅 Seasonality: Are there distinct peak seasons for bookings?

⭐ Quality Drivers: What factors correlate with higher review scores?

📂 Data Source

Source: Inside Airbnb (or Kaggle/Custom Dataset)

Key Attributes: Price, Room Type, Review Scores, Number of Reviews, Availability (365), Location (Lat/Long).
